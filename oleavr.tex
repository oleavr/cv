\subsection{Open Source}
\cventry{2010--present}{Founder and Maintainer}{http://www.frida.re}{}{}
{I created Frida out of both the passion for, as well as a need for,
cross-platform dynamic binary instrumentation. There were no other good
tools in that space, so I wrote a small set of libraries that eventually
ballooned in functionality, eventually leading to me open-sourcing them.
I have been working on improving them over the past 5 years so the rest
of the world could use them, and to generally help it become the de facto
dynamic instrumentation toolset. It has been a great catalyst for me giving
talks and building demos (like http://youtu.be/dvOdwHpQycw), and generally
getting to know the reverse-engineering community at large.\linebreak
\linebreak
It has also spawned a couple of other neat side-projects like
CryptoShark (http://youtu.be/hzDsxtcRavY), and
CloudSpy (http://build.frida.re:8000/p/3Ftvry).}
